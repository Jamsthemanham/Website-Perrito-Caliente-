        Here at The Hot Dog! we strive to bring you the best quality, and taste out there. unlike your usual hotdog we use meat that was not just leftover. we use a mix of pork and beef to bring out the best of both and our
        meat is ground right in our stores. We arent going to bore you with a backstory or tell you why our mascot is a weiner dog because our flavour and service will speak for itself. We have both indoor and outdoor seating and
        if you prefer staying at home we have an amazing delivery service with a 30 minute delivery time or you get your dogs free! We hope you will give us a shot and join the millions who enjoy our hot dogs every day.
